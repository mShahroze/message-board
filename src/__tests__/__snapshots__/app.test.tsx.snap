            Could someone point out to me, what the benefit of winning the group is? I mean, both finalists of the group will qualify for the Spring Finals? So what is the point of fighting for 1st? Bragginâ€™ rights?

            Blast has the best presentation and production of all the ongoing series at the moment, my favourite without a doubt. That sounded like a paid advertisement, but I really just like the series
